# 80forty Keyboard

The utility of an 80% keyboard in a 40% form factor.

Loosely inspired by the design of the OP-1 Synthesizer, in a layout that is ortholinear and minimal, but retains the keys that helpful for everyday computing and specialized tasks like graphic design applications.

Partly motivated by the appearance of [Deadline Studio DOYS keycaps]([url](https://deadline.space/products/doys-keycaps)), but works with any MX-compatible keycaps.

Supports low-profile KS33 switches (with hotswap sockets) as well as MX switches (soldered).

## V1 Case Designs

Version 1 uses either a stacked acrylic or ”skeleton” FR4 plate design.

While the PCB supports either KS33 or MX switches, the current case designs have only been settled for the KS33 switches. MX switches require more space, and would likely require larger middle case layers.

### Stacked Acrylic Case

This case uses the standard FR4 top plate of the 80forty, and sandwiches it in a few layers of 5mm, lasercut acrylic.

### Skeleton FR4 Case

This case uses the standard FR4 top and bottom plates of the 80forty, with standoffs providing middle separation for the switches.

## Configuration Options

Configurable with either 1 large knob or 4 macro keys.

## Original Vision Mockups

The project was conceived to allow a sleek, low-profile, CNC aluminum case design. This is still a goal, but there is no current timeline for this version.

In the slightly nearer term, the intention is to prototype this case with 3D printing. If anyone out there is interested in creating this 3D case and contributing it to the project, let us know in the issues or in a pull request!
