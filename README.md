# EightyForty

The utility of an 80% keyboard, in a 40% form factor.

Configurable with either 1 large knob or 4 macro keys.

## V1 mockups

The initial prototypes will be made with a straightforward FR4 plate design. Layered acrylic will likely be added if the layout is working well.

## Vision mockups

The project was conceived to allow a sleek, low-profile, CNC case design. This is still a goal, but there is no current timeline for this version.
