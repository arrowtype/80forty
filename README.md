# 80Forty

The utility of an 80% keyboard in a 40% form factor.

Loosely inspired by the design of the OP-1 Synthesizer, in a layout that is ortholinear and minimal, but retains the keys that helpful for everyday computing and specialized tasks like graphic design applications.

Supports low-profile KS33 switches (with hotswap sockets) as well as MX switches (soldered).

## V1 case design

Version 1 uses either a stacked acrylic or ”skeleton” FR4 plate design.

## Vision mockups

The project was conceived to allow a sleek, low-profile, CNC case design. This is still a goal, but there is no current timeline for this version.
